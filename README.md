## Description

DSPP (Dual Screen PDF Presenter) is a presentation software (such as Microsoft
PowerPoint, Apple Keynote and Libre Office Impress).
It can show simultaneously two PDF files on multiple screens.
It uses Keynote-like multi-monitor output to provide meta information to the
speaker.
Thus, DSPP can show a normal presentation window on the first screen (usually a
video projector) and personal notes for the speaker on the second one (usually a
laptop screen used for the presentation).

DSPP is written in Python and released under the MIT license.
